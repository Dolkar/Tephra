## About

Tephra aspires to provide a modern alternative to high-level graphics APIs like OpenGL and DirectX 11, while leveraging the benefits of the underlying Vulkan ecosystem. Its goal is to strike a good balance between ease-of-use, performance and applicability. To that end, Tephra provides:
- A high-level job system for submitting batches of work to the GPU (or other accelerators that expose the Vulkan API)
- Low-level command lists that can be recorded in parallel and with minimal overhead
- An easy and efficient way to create temporary images, staging buffers and scratch memory
- A general-purpose interface that tries not to impose architectural decisions upon the user (such as render graphs, callbacks, or the concept of frames)
- The ability to use bleeding-edge features of graphics hardware through direct interoperability with the Vulkan API
- An introductory user guide [LINK] with examples for getting started with using the library
- Extensive documentation [LINK] and debugging features
